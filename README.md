## Challenges

I was bested by spelling As I feel every Software Engineer has been at some point or another.
    I wasn't persisting a sign up or in, upon lots of checking over code and confusion. With some assistence I managed to find out that
    I had spelt the 'access_token' on the back end different to the front end. The same went for signing in and making the formData name 'username',
    instead of what it should have been 'username_or_email'
